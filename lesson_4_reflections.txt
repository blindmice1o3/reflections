"remote" means a remote repository (Github), and it's something we have to associate with our local Git repository. 

We can see a list of remotes ("git remote") just like we can see a list of branches ("git branch").

"git remote add origin https://github.com/blindmice1o3/reflections.git"
this command creates a remote, it adds a copy of our local repository to our remote (which is labeled as "origin") to a server (the argument with the url).

"git remote -v" -> this command will list all the remotes associated with our local repository, in a verbose manner (shows you more info than regular git remote)

"git push origin master" -> push the commits from my "master" branch onto the remote server labeled "origin"

by default, the branch pushed onto Github will have the same name as the branch from my local repository.

"git pull origin -> like git push, git pull needs to specify the "remote" (which we named "origin"), we also need to specify the branch we want to pull (which is the master branch on the remote)



Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. We may use a remote repository rather than keeping all our work local when we work collaboratively with team members or if we're using different (multiple) computers.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. We may not want changes from other people working on the project just yet. Always pulling the changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with our remote repository will give us that control.
